       <p>In February 1962, Marley recorded four songs, "Judge Not", "One Cup of Coffee",
          "Do You Still Love Me?" and "Terror", at Federal Studios for local music producer Leslie Kong.
           Three of the songs were released on Beverley's with "One Cup of Coffee" being released under the pseudonym

       <p>In 1966, Marley married Rita Anderson, and moved near his mother's residence in Wilmington,
          Delaware in the United States for a short time,
          during which he worked as a DuPont lab assistant and on the assembly line at a Chrysler plant in nearby Newark,
          under the alias Donald Marley.[36]</p>

       <p>Though raised as a Catholic, Marley became interested in Rastafari beliefs in the 1960s,
          when away from his mother's influence.[37] After returning to Jamaica,
          Marley formally converted to Rastafari and began to grow dreadlocks.</p>
